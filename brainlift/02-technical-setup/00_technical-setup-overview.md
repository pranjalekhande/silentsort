## üö® CRITICAL PATH ITEMS

**These must be working before you start coding:**
- [ ] Node.js and Git installed
- [ ] GitHub repository created and cloned
- [ ] OpenAI API key obtained and tested
- [ ] Basic Electron app structure created
- [ ] File watcher functionality tested

**Found in all documents - prioritize these first!**

---

## üìä SETUP PHASES OVERVIEW

### **Phase 1: Environment** (30-45 min)
Get your development machine ready
- Install tools, create repo, get API keys

### **Phase 2: Foundation** (45-60 min) 
Create the basic app structure
- Electron setup, React, TypeScript, file watcher

### **Phase 3: AI Integration** (30-45 min)
Connect AI services and test basic functionality
- OpenAI integration, content analysis, basic UI

### **Phase 4: Core Features** (60-90 min)
Build the main file processing pipeline
- File operations, organization rules, system tray

### **Phase 5: Polish** (30-45 min)
Make it production-ready
- Error handling, build process, testing

---

## üîç VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS

After completing setup, you should be able to:
- [ ] Open SilentSort app window
- [ ] Watch a folder for new files
- [ ] Send file content to OpenAI API
- [ ] Get filename suggestions back
- [ ] Rename files automatically
- [ ] Show progress in system tray

**If any of these fail, return to the setup documentation.**

---

## üõü EMERGENCY SHORTCUTS

**If you're stuck and need to code immediately:**

1. **Skip everything except:**
   - Install Node.js: `brew install node@18`
   - Create folder: `mkdir silentsort && cd silentsort`
   - Get OpenAI key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Install basics: `npm init -y && npm install electron openai`

2. **Create minimal files:**
   - `main.js` (basic Electron window)
   - `package.json` (scripts to run)
   - `.env` (API key storage)

3. **Start coding the core logic**

4. **Come back to proper setup later**

---

## üìà SUCCESS INDICATORS

**You're ready to start development when:**
- Your setup documents show 80%+ completion
- Basic Electron app opens without errors
- OpenAI API calls work from your app
- File watcher detects changes in target folders
- You can build/run the app reliably

**At this point, move to actual SilentSort development!**

---

## üîó NEXT STEPS

**After completing technical setup:**
1. Review the Product Requirements Document (`../01-silentsort-workflows/03_silentsort-product-requirements-document.md`)
2. Start with Week 1 development plan (file watcher + basic rules)
3. Implement AI integration in Week 2
4. Add advanced features in Weeks 3-4
