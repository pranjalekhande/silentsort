## ü§ñ PHASE 3: AI INTEGRATION (30-45 minutes)
*Get basic AI functionality working*

### **9. OpenAI Integration (20 minutes)**
```bash
npm install openai
```
Test basic OpenAI API call from renderer process

### **10. Basic Content Analysis (15 minutes)**
Create simple function that:
- Reads file content
- Sends to OpenAI for filename suggestion
- Returns suggested name

**Test with a single file manually**

### **11. Simple UI (10 minutes)**
Create basic React interface showing:
- File being processed
- Suggested new name
- Accept/Reject buttons

---

## üì¶ PHASE 4: CORE FEATURES (60-90 minutes)
*Make it actually useful*

### **12. File Processing Pipeline (30 minutes)**
- Detect file changes
- Extract content based on file type
- Generate intelligent filenames
- Show user suggestions

### **13. File Operations (20 minutes)**
- Rename files safely
- Move files to organized folders
- Undo functionality

### **14. Basic Organization Rules (20 minutes)**
```
Downloads/Invoice_*.pdf ‚Üí Documents/Invoices/
Downloads/Screenshot_*.png ‚Üí Pictures/Screenshots/
Downloads/*_resume.pdf ‚Üí Documents/Resumes/
```

### **15. System Tray Integration (10 minutes)**
- Basic tray icon
- Show/hide main window
- Status indicators

---

## ‚ö° PHASE 5: POLISH & DEPLOY (30-45 minutes)
*Make it production ready*

### **16. Error Handling (15 minutes)**
- Try/catch around API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful failures

### **17. Basic Build Process (15 minutes)**
```bash
npm install -D electron-builder
```
Configure basic build for macOS

### **18. Final Testing (15 minutes)**
- Test with real files
- Test error scenarios
- Performance check

---

## üéØ PRIORITY DECISION TREE

**If you have limited time, focus on:**

### **2 Hours Available:**
- Complete Phase 1 + Phase 2
- **Result:** Basic Electron app that can watch files

### **4 Hours Available:**  
- Complete Phase 1-3
- **Result:** Working AI file processor with basic UI

### **6+ Hours Available:**
- Complete all phases
- **Result:** Functional SilentSort ready for daily use

---

## üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **Must Have Working First:**
1. **File Watcher** - Detect when files are added/changed
2. **OpenAI Integration** - Basic API call working
3. **File Rename** - Actually rename files safely
4. **Basic UI** - Show what's happening

### **Can Add Later:**
- Supabase database
- n8n workflows  
- LangGraph complex workflows
- Advanced UI polish
- Code signing
- Auto-updater

## üõü TROUBLESHOOTING SHORTCUTS

### **Common Issues & Quick Fixes:**

**Electron won't start:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**TypeScript errors:**
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit  # Check for errors
```

**OpenAI API not working:**
- Check API key is correct
- Verify billing is set up
- Test with curl first

**File watcher not triggering:**
- Check file path permissions
- Test with console.log first
- Verify chokidar configuration

---

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

**You're ready to start advanced features when:**
- [ ] App opens reliably
- [ ] Can process at least 3 different file types
- [ ] Suggested filenames are reasonably good
- [ ] Can rename files without breaking anything
- [ ] Basic error handling works

**After completing this guide, you should have:**
- Working SilentSort prototype (80% of core functionality)
- Solid foundation for advanced features
- Clear understanding of technical architecture
- Confidence to tackle the full TODO list
