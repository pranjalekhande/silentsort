## 1. CORE PAIN POINTS ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Manual Organization Burden
**Pain Point:** Users spend excessive time manually organizing files
- Constant decision-making on where files belong
- Inconsistent naming conventions across projects
- Time lost searching for misplaced files
- Procrastination leading to desktop/download folder chaos

### 1.2 Context Loss Over Time
**Pain Point:** File context disappears as projects evolve
- Files named generically (Document1.pdf, Screenshot.png)
- No connection between related files across folders
- Project history becomes fragmented
- Difficult to understand file purpose months later

### 1.3 Cross-Project File Relationships
**Pain Point:** Related files scattered across different project folders
- Research materials used in multiple projects
- Templates and resources not easily discoverable
- Duplicate files across different contexts
- No way to track file usage patterns

### 1.4 Dynamic Workflow Adaptation
**Pain Point:** Static folder structures don't match evolving workflows
- Rigid hierarchies become outdated
- New project types don't fit existing structure
- Seasonal or temporary projects clutter permanent structure
- No flexibility for different work contexts
