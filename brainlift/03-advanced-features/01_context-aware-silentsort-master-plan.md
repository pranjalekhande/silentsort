# SilentSort 2.0 - Context-Aware Intelligence Master Plan
## Advanced Folder Analysis + Bulletproof Robustness

**Vision**: Transform SilentSort from a file renamer into a **Project Intelligence System** that understands folder contexts, relationships, and structures while being bulletproof and fault-tolerant.

---

## üéØ **CORE CONCEPT: FROM FILES TO PROJECTS**

### **Current State**: Individual File Processing
- ‚úÖ Single file analysis and renaming
- ‚úÖ AI-powered naming suggestions  
- ‚úÖ 90%+ confidence ratings

### **Target State**: Project Context Intelligence
- üéØ **Folder Type Detection** - "This is a React project", "This is a legal case"
- üéØ **File Relationship Mapping** - "These files belong together"
- üéØ **Missing Component Detection** - "Your project needs a README"
- üéØ **Smart Restructuring** - "Here's the optimal organization"
- üéØ **Context-Aware Naming** - Rename based on project context
- üéØ **No Repeated Suggestions** - Remember processed files

---

## üèóÔ∏è **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **Enhanced Python LangGraph Service**
```python
# Multi-step context analysis workflow
class ProjectIntelligenceWorkflow:
    nodes = [
        "scan_folder_tree",      # Full directory analysis
        "detect_project_type",   # Web, legal, design, research, etc.
        "analyze_relationships", # Find file connections
        "identify_missing",      # What's absent but should exist
        "suggest_structure",     # Optimal organization
        "context_rename",        # Smart renaming with context
        "update_memory"          # Remember what's been processed
    ]
```

### **Local Memory System**
```typescript
// SQLite database for processing memory
interface ProcessingMemory {
  file_hash: string;        // File content hash
  folder_path: string;      // Where it lives
  last_processed: Date;     // When we analyzed it
  ai_suggestion: string;    // What we suggested
  user_action: 'accepted' | 'rejected' | 'modified';
  context_type: string;     // Project type context
}
```

## üìã **IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**

## **PHASE 1: ROBUST FOUNDATION (Week 1)**
*Build bulletproof core before adding intelligence*

### **Day 1-2: Safe File Operations**
- **Transaction-based file operations** with rollback
- **Permission checking** before any changes
- **Disk space validation** 
- **File lock detection** and retry logic
- **Atomic operations** - all or nothing

### **Day 3-4: Processing Infrastructure**
- **Smart processing queue** - prevent system overload
- **File deduplication** - don't process same file twice
- **Error recovery system** - graceful failure handling
- **Resource monitoring** - memory, CPU, disk usage

### **Day 5-7: Operation Logging & Undo**
- **SQLite operation log** - every action recorded
- **Undo functionality** - reverse any operation
- **Processing memory** - remember what's been done
- **Health monitoring** - system status dashboard

---

## **PHASE 2: CONTEXT INTELLIGENCE (Week 2)**
*Add the smart folder analysis capabilities*

### **Day 1-3: LangGraph Folder Analysis**
```python
# Advanced folder analysis workflow
class FolderAnalysisWorkflow:
    def analyze_folder_context(self, folder_path: str):
        # 1. Scan all files and subdirectories
        # 2. Detect patterns (package.json = web project)
        # 3. Analyze file contents for relationships
        # 4. Identify project type with confidence
        # 5. Map file relationships
        # 6. Suggest optimal structure
```

**Project Type Detection:**
- **Web Development** - package.json, src/, .js/.tsx files
- **Legal Case** - contracts, correspondence, evidence folders
- **Design Project** - .psd/.fig files, assets/, mockups/
- **Research** - papers/, data/, analysis/, references/
- **Business** - invoices/, contracts/, proposals/

### **Day 4-5: Relationship Mapping**
```python
class FileRelationshipAnalyzer:
    def find_relationships(self, files: List[FileInfo]):
        # Content analysis for references
        # Naming pattern detection
        # Date/version correlation
        # File type grouping
        # Cross-reference detection
```

**Relationship Types:**
- **Master/Supporting** - main document + attachments
- **Version Chain** - v1, v2, v3 of same document
- **Content References** - HTML references CSS/JS/images
- **Date Correlation** - files from same meeting/project
- **Topic Grouping** - similar content themes

### **Day 6-7: Missing File Detection**
```python
class MissingComponentDetector:
    def suggest_missing_files(self, project_type: str, existing_files: List[str]):
        # Based on project type, suggest what's missing
        # Web: README.md, .gitignore, package.json
        # Legal: index/, timeline/, evidence-log/
        # Design: style-guide/, assets-organized/
```

---

## **PHASE 3: SMART RESTRUCTURING (Week 3)**
*Implement the reorganization suggestions*

### **Day 1-3: Structure Templates**
```python
# Project-specific organization templates
STRUCTURE_TEMPLATES = {
    "web-project": {
        "src/": ["components/", "pages/", "styles/"],
        "docs/": ["README.md", "API.md"],
        "assets/": ["images/", "fonts/", "icons/"],
        "tests/": ["unit/", "integration/"]
    },
    "legal-case": {
        "00-case-overview/": ["case-summary.md", "timeline.md"],
        "01-pleadings/": ["complaint.pdf", "answer.pdf"],
        "02-discovery/": ["requests/", "responses/", "depositions/"],
        "03-correspondence/": ["with-opposing/", "with-client/"],
        "04-evidence/": ["exhibits/", "witness-statements/"]
    }
}
```

### **Day 4-5: Context-Aware Renaming**
```python
class ContextualRenamer:
    def rename_with_context(self, file: FileInfo, context: ProjectContext):
        # Consider project type
        # Look at related files
        # Apply naming conventions
        # Maintain consistency
```

**Examples:**
- In web project: `image1.jpg` ‚Üí `hero-banner.jpg` (based on CSS usage)
- In legal case: `document.pdf` ‚Üí `motion-to-dismiss-2024-07-01.pdf`
- In design project: `mockup.fig` ‚Üí `homepage-mobile-wireframe-v2.fig`

### **Day 6-7: Reorganization Engine**
```python
class SmartReorganizer:
    def suggest_reorganization(self, folder_analysis: FolderAnalysis):
        # Create reorganization plan
        # Estimate impact and benefits  
        # Provide preview before execution
        # Execute with user approval
```

---

## **PHASE 4: ADVANCED FEATURES (Week 4)**
*Polish and enhance the intelligence*

### **Day 1-2: Learning System**
```python
class LearningEngine:
    def learn_from_user_actions(self, user_feedback: UserAction):
        # Track what users accept/reject
        # Improve future suggestions
        # Adapt to user preferences
        # Update confidence models
```

### **Day 3-4: Batch Processing**
```python
class BatchProcessor:
    def process_folder_hierarchy(self, root_path: str):
        # Analyze entire folder tree
        # Suggest comprehensive reorganization
        # Handle large projects efficiently
        # Provide progress feedback
```

### **Day 5-7: Advanced Integrations**
- **Git Integration** - Understand git repositories
- **IDE Integration** - Detect project frameworks
- **Cloud Sync** - Optional backup of organization decisions
- **Export/Import** - Share organization templates

### **Data Safety (Zero Data Loss)**
```typescript
class SafeFileManager {
  async executeWithRollback<T>(operation: FileOperation): Promise<Result<T>> {
    const checkpoint = await this.createCheckpoint();
    try {
      const result = await this.performOperation(operation);
      await this.commitCheckpoint(checkpoint);
      return Result.success(result);
    } catch (error) {
      await this.rollbackToCheckpoint(checkpoint);
      return Result.failure(error);
    }
  }
}
```

### **Processing Memory (No Repeated Suggestions)**
```typescript
interface ProcessingCache {
  fileHash: string;           // SHA-256 of file content
  lastProcessed: Date;        // When we last analyzed it
  aiSuggestion: string;       // What we suggested
  userDecision: UserAction;   // What user chose
  contextId: string;          // Project context when processed
}

class IntelligentProcessor {
  async shouldProcess(filePath: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const hash = await this.calculateFileHash(filePath);
    const cached = await this.getFromCache(hash);
    
    // Don't reprocess if recently handled
    return !cached || this.hasContextChanged(cached.contextId);
  }
}
```

### **System Health Monitoring**
```typescript
interface SystemHealth {
  aiServiceUptime: number;
  processingQueueSize: number;
  memoryUsage: number;
  diskSpace: number;
  errorRate: number;
  lastBackup: Date;
}

class HealthMonitor {
  async checkHealth(): Promise<SystemHealth> {
    // Monitor all system components
    // Auto-recover from failures
    // Alert on resource exhaustion
    // Maintain performance metrics
  }
}
```
