## 🔄 WORKFLOW SPECIFICATIONS

### **File Processing Workflow (Primary):**

#### **Step 1: File Detection (Deterministic)**
```
Input: New file in monitored folders
Processing:
1. Extract basic metadata (name, size, type, path)
2. Check file accessibility and permissions
3. Determine processing priority (recent files first)
4. Queue for analysis

Output: FileMetadata object
Duration: <10ms
```

#### **Step 2: Content Analysis (Hybrid)**
```
Deterministic Branch (90% of files):
1. Apply file extension rules (.pdf → Documents/)
2. Check user-defined patterns
3. Use existing folder structure hints
4. Generate rule-based name if possible

Non-Deterministic Branch (10% of files):
1. Extract file content (OCR, text parsing)
2. Analyze content with AI (OpenAI API)
3. Generate intelligent filename suggestions
4. Determine optimal folder location

Output: ProcessingRecommendation object
Duration: 50ms-2s depending on branch
```

#### **Step 3: Confidence Assessment & Routing**
```
Confidence Levels:
├── High (>90%) → Auto-process silently
├── Medium (70-90%) → Process with gentle notification
├── Low (50-70%) → Show suggestion, require approval
└── Very Low (<50%) → Show options, ask for guidance
```

#### **Step 4: Action Execution & Feedback**
```
File Operations:
1. Rename file (if different from original)
2. Move to target folder (create if needed)
3. Handle naming conflicts (append number)
4. Update local database with metadata
5. Create search index entry

User Feedback:
1. Update system tray icon
2. Add to recent activity feed
3. Show notification (if confidence level requires)
4. Log action for undo capability
```

### **Search Workflow (Secondary):**

#### **Search Execution Flow:**
```
1. User Input Processing
   ├── Normalize query text
   ├── Extract search intent (file name, content, type)
   └── Prepare search parameters

2. Multi-Modal Search
   ├── Filename matching (fuzzy search)
   ├── Content full-text search
   ├── Metadata filtering
   └── AI semantic similarity

3. Result Ranking & Enhancement
   ├── Relevance scoring
   ├── Recency weighting
   ├── User interaction history
   └── Context enhancement

4. Results Presentation
   ├── List view with previews
   ├── Quick action buttons
   ├── Related file suggestions
   └── Search result analytics
```
