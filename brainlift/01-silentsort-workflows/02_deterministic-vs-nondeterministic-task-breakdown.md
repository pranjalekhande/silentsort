## ⚖️ HYBRID DECISION MATRIX

### **When to Use Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic**

#### **File Processing Decision Tree:**
```
File Detected
├── Simple Case (common extension + clear pattern)
│   └── ✅ DETERMINISTIC ONLY (fast, reliable)
├── Complex Case (unclear content or context)
│   └── ❓ NON-DETERMINISTIC ANALYSIS required
└── Mixed Case (some clear, some unclear aspects)
    └── 🔀 HYBRID (deterministic first, AI for unclear parts)
```

#### **Search Decision Tree:**
```
Search Query Received
├── Simple Query ("*.pdf", "documents from today")
│   └── ✅ DETERMINISTIC SEARCH (fast database lookup)
├── Complex Query ("that marketing document from Sarah")
│   └── ❓ NON-DETERMINISTIC ANALYSIS (AI understanding)
└── Mixed Query ("PDFs about marketing from last month")
    └── 🔀 HYBRID (filter + semantic search)
```

    def execute(self, state):
        # 1. Try deterministic approach first
        deterministic_result = self.try_deterministic(state)
        
        if deterministic_result.confidence > 0.9:
            return deterministic_result
        
        # 2. Use AI for unclear cases
        ai_result = self.try_ai_analysis(state)
        
        # 3. Combine results with confidence weighting
        return self.merge_results(deterministic_result, ai_result)
```

## 🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS

### **Design Principles:**
1. **Deterministic First** - Always try fast, reliable rules before AI
2. **AI for Edge Cases** - Use intelligence when rules fail
3. **Confidence-Based Routing** - Let confidence scores decide approach
4. **Graceful Fallbacks** - Always have deterministic backup
5. **User Control** - Allow users to prefer deterministic or AI approaches

### **Performance Strategy:**
- **90% of files** should be handled deterministically (fast)
- **10% of complex files** need AI analysis (slower but smarter)
- **User corrections** improve both rule accuracy and AI performance

*This clear separation allows us to build a system that's both fast and intelligent - using deterministic speed for common cases and AI intelligence for complex scenarios.*
